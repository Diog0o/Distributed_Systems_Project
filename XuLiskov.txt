1. Client sends S (string pattern) to all Servers.
2. Each Server locks all matching tuples once or blocks until match appears. 
	all - that match the regex expression
	once - if the same exact tuple exists twice, only one gets locked
3. Each Server sends back the tuples they locked; or a refused message if at least one of the matching tuples were already blocked
|
|--> If all the responses were accepted and all share at least one tuple: 
|	The client chooses one randomly from the shared tuples
|
|--> If not all Servers have responded within a reasonable time
|    or if all responded but only a majority accepted
|    or if all accepted but the intersection is empty:
|	Repeat/Start Over 1.
|     
|Else: (All responded but only a minority accepted)
	Client tells servers who made locks in 2. to release them
	Delay(smallRandomValue)
	Repeat/Start Over 1.
